# Change Resolution

I mainly created this for myself because I play quite a bit of Fortnite and I do so playing in stretched resolution to allow for higher FPS and more vertical FOV. This script allows me to change the resolution of my monitor using a macro key on my keyboard so I don't have to constantly open Nvidia Control Panel to change my resolution between stretched and native resolution.

## Getting Started

These instructions are very broad as you should have basic knowledge about developers tools and environments as it requires use of command line arguments.

### Instructions

You should have Python 3 and PIP installed, if you need to learn how to install those just look it up on YouTube, it's pretty self explanatory. <br><br>
After that you will need to install pywin32 using PIP in the command line. Make sure you have Python added to the PATH in environmental values, then just launch the command prompt and type in:
```
pip install pywin32
```
Now, you should be all set to use the script as is. Feel free to modify it to tailor your needs. Have fun and enjoy!
